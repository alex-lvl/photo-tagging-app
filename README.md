# Photo Tagging App (Where's Waldo)

This project is a "Where's Waldo" type game using react and firebase.

## Overview

Where's waldo is a puzzle game where a player is tasked to find waldo, a character that is hidden within a crowd or objects. This project takes the same concepts of Where's Waldo and is set in a disney princess theme. The player must find all the characters listed as fast as possible and will be provided the oppurtunity to post their score to the leaderboards!

## Functionality

The player may choose between two games, finding Sleeping Beauty or finding Cinderella.

Once the player chooses a game, the player is provided an image on the screen and must find all the characters listed. The player must click on a character and choose the correct character from the dropdown menu popup. The character will turn faded if chosen correctly. Once all characters are found, the game is over and the player is provided their completion time in seconds and may post their results by typing their name and submitting. If the player chooses, they may try again.

The leaderboard page may be observed by clicking the link on the navigation bar. Clicking one of two images will fetch the leaderboard scores. 

## Things To Work On

Have anonymous users signed in and grab their uuid in order to update their previous results if submitted before.
